# Road-accident-analysis
This repository showcases a series of data analysis projects focused on understanding and mitigating road accidents. The projects utilize various data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series analysis. Below are the descriptions of each project included in this repository.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Description: This project focuses on the initial step of data analysis - cleaning and preprocessing raw road accident data. The process involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data into a usable format. Various techniques are employed to ensure the dataset is accurate and comprehensive for further analysis.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy
Key Features: Missing data imputation, data normalization, outlier detection, data transformation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description: This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis to uncover significant patterns and insights within the road accident data. The EDA process includes visualizing data distributions, identifying accident hotspots, and analyzing correlations between different variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and accident severity.

Technologies Used: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Key Features: Data visualization, correlation analysis, trend identification, statistical summaries
3. Time Series Analysis of Road Accidents
Description: This project performs a time series analysis to examine trends and seasonal patterns in road accident data over time. Techniques such as ARIMA and SARIMA models are used to forecast future accident occurrences and identify periods of high risk.

Technologies Used: Python, Statsmodels, Pandas
Key Features: Time series decomposition, trend analysis, seasonality detection, forecasting
4. Data Integration and Feature Engineering
Description: In this project, various data sources are integrated to enrich the road accident dataset. Feature engineering techniques are applied to create new variables that can enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. This includes adding features related to traffic density, weather conditions, and road types.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy
Key Features: Data merging, feature creation, variable transformation, data enrichment
5. Comparative Analysis of Accident Factors
Description: This project aims to compare different factors contributing to road accidents across various regions and time periods. By analyzing multiple datasets, it identifies common causes and unique factors influencing accident rates. The insights gained can help in formulating targeted road safety strategies.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Key Features: Comparative analysis, regional factor comparison, causation analysis, visualization
